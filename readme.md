Implementation of the mu0 processor in VHDL for EENG34040
===
This is intended largely for undergrads on eeng34040 at the University of Bristol, but help yourself all the same. More info can be found on the manchester universtity website.

Notes
---
I have decided to make all of the registers in separate files, though they will largly be the same thing. This will make it easy when we want to experiement with speed enhancements and caches.

I will give push access to anyone who wishes to share their code with the rest of us :)
